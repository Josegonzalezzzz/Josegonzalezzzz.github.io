### CPSC 120

*Lab 03, Part 2
    Lab 03, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because it was one of the first labs where I really felt as if I was programming actual code.  I was able to write functions for a calendar where it would subtract the number of days from two given dates and output the days in between.  I enjoyed using the functions that we used because it was my first time using embedded functions that take seperate variables in the same function.

*Lab 01
    Lab 01 was actually a subtle favorite of mine, even to this day.  This was my first program ever, and although if I remember correctly, we did not even code, we just made changes to the header.  However, this was my first chance to use git and all its commands, such as being able to push and commit my work for the first time.  I think the fact that it prints out "Hello World!" is what makes it special to me.

*Lab 07, Part 1
    Lab 07 , part 1 was also my favorite lab because it was my first intent at a guessing game.  This lab taught me a lot, specifically with using while, if, else if statements in order to take care of very possible secenario in the guessing game.  This lab reminded me of a card game I used to play a lot with my father so it was actually fun being able to complete it into a program.
